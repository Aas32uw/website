# Become a YOURLS Sponsor

YOURLS is an [MIT licensed](https://github.com/YOURLS/YOURLS/blob/master/LICENSE)
open source project and completely free to use.
The tremendous amount of effort needed to maintain such a large ecosystem and
develop new features for the project is only made sustainable thanks to the
generous financial backing of our sponsors.

## How to Sponsor

Sponsorships can be done via the following methods:

- [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/YOURLS)
- [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/YOURLS)

Invoices can be obtained via GitHub's payment system.
Both monthly-recurring sponsorships and one-time donations are accepted.
Recurring sponsorships are entitled to logo placements as specified in [Sponsorship Tiers](#tier-benefits).
